This project is a part of my learning process with Selenium WebDriver using the Java programming language, aimed at
building automation testing skills. This mini project focuses on testing web applications and gaining hands-on
experience with automation tools, utilizing a hybrid automation framework incorporating Selenium, Java, Maven, TestNG,
and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern, preparing me for a career as a software tester.
